## Nutrition App Tracker

This is a repo for my Nutrition Tracking App. This app stemmed from a final project in my Web Development class. The basic features, like logging personal food portions, came from my final project. Other newer revisions, like changes to the style, framework (React), language (TypeScript), and food data (from USDA) came from my motivation to make this project better.

### Main Features
- Logging portions of food one may consume throughout the day.
- Provide daily summary of nutritional data.
- Create personal food items along with using food pulled from USDA

#### Important Note
- The login function has a "secret" to hash the passwords. This secret is public as of now only because I am using the login to hold user tied data, and the login secret or process will be changed in the future.
